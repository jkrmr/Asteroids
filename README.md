Asteroids
=========

### Hunt Down Maurauding Space Bubbles and Kill Them Before They Kill You!!

The classic arcade game, sped up, written in plain JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas.

## Features

* "Drag" (er..no drag in space...reverse thrusters?) for natural-feeling ship motion
* Increasing number of asteroids with every new level
* Cool starfield background
* Shiny Space Bullets

## Dependencies

Uses Thomas Fuchs's [KeyMaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) library.

The game also renders much better on WebKit browsers (e.g., Safari and Google Chrome) than on Firefox.

## Acknowledgements

Mark Pilgrim's [Dive Into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info) tutorial and 
Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html) were
great resources in creating this.


## Future additions

* Asteroids breaking up into smaller asteroids upon being shot
* Asteroids created with random size
* Asteroids created with jagged edges
* Game music!
